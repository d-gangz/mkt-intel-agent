# Conversation Summary - LangGraph Agent Implementation

## 1. Primary Request and Intent

The user requested building a comprehensive LangGraph agent for market intelligence with the following specifications:

1. **Two Tool Functions**:
   - Tool 1: `hybrid_search` - Performs hybrid search (vector + full-text) on LanceDB to query document chunks, returns results with chunk_ids for citation
   - Tool 2: `sql_query` - Executes SQL queries against SQLite database (owid-co2-data.db) for quantitative analysis

2. **Agent Capabilities**:
   - Process multiple queries (list of queries)
   - Return structured output with response text and citations (chunk_ids)
   - Include comprehensive system prompt with full SQLite database schema
   - Follow langgraph-dev-guide.md best practices

3. **System Prompt Requirements**:
   - Include detailed CO2 emissions database schema with all columns, types, descriptions, units
   - Provide data characteristics and filtering guidelines
   - Include example SQL queries for reference

4. **Example Queries**:
   - Initially requested diverse queries (not obvious ones from system prompt)
   - Final specification: 5 queries total
     - 1 qualitative (document-based insights)
     - 2 quantitative (statistical/trend analysis)
     - 2 combined (qualitative context + quantitative data)

5. **Implementation Details**:
   - Create in search-agent/agent.py
   - Reference provided sample LangGraph script with tools
   - Export as 'app' for deployment
   - Include langgraph.json configuration

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

- **LangGraph**: Agent framework for building stateful LLM applications with tool calling
- **MessagesState**: LangGraph state management pattern for message-based workflows
- **Hybrid Search**: Combination of vector similarity search and full-text search in LanceDB
- **Vector Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (512 dimensions) for semantic search
- **LanceDB**: Cloud vector database (uri: db://alix-partners-48x6ob, region: us-east-1)
- **SQLite**: Relational database for CO2 emissions data (1750-2023)
- **Tool Binding**: LangChain pattern for attaching tools to LLMs
- **ReAct Pattern**: Reasoning and Acting pattern for agent decision-making
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Anthropic LLM (model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) with temperature=0
- **Structured Output**: Pydantic models for response formatting with citations
- **System Prompt Engineering**: Comprehensive context including database schemas and guidelines

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### search-agent/agent.py (527 lines)
**Purpose**: Main LangGraph agent implementation with hybrid search and SQL query capabilities

**Key Components**:

```python
# Database Connections
db = lancedb.connect(uri="db://alix-partners-48x6ob", region="us-east-1")
embeddings = get_registry().get("openai").create(
    name="text-embedding-3-small", dim=512
)
SQLITE_DB_PATH = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "data-process" / "databases" / "owid-co2-data.db"
```

**Tool 1 - Hybrid Search**:
```python
@tool
def hybrid_search(query: str, limit: int = 5) -> str:
    """Search document database using hybrid search (vector + full-text)."""
    table = db.open_table("documents")
    results = (
        table.search(
            query,
            query_type="hybrid",
            vector_column_name="vector",
            fts_columns="text",
        )
        .limit(limit)
        .to_pandas()
    )
    # Returns formatted results with chunk_ids, sources, relevance scores
```

**Tool 2 - SQL Query** (CRITICAL CORRECTION):
Initial implementation accepted "question" parameter, but user corrected that the LLM should generate SQL queries and the tool should only execute them.

Final implementation:
```python
@tool
def sql_query(sql: str) -> str:
    """Execute SQL queries against the CO2 emissions database.

    Args:
        sql: The SQL SELECT query to execute against the database
    """
    # Security: Only allow SELECT queries
    sql_upper = sql.strip().upper()
    if not sql_upper.startswith("SELECT"):
        return "Error: Only SELECT queries are allowed."

    conn = sqlite3.connect(SQLITE_DB_PATH)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(sql)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    # Returns formatted results with column names and data
```

**System Prompt** (extensive - includes full database schema):
- 45+ columns documented with types, descriptions, units
- Data characteristics (255 countries, 1750-2023 range)
- Filtering guidelines for aggregate regions, NULL handling
- 5 example SQL query patterns
- Citation and response formatting guidelines

**LangGraph Setup**:
```python
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", temperature=0)
tools = [hybrid_search, sql_query]
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

graph_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)
graph_builder.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges("chatbot", tools_condition)
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")

graph = graph_builder.compile()
app = graph  # Export for deployment
```

**Example Queries** (Final Version):
```python
example_queries = [
    # Qualitative: Document-based insights
    "What are the key challenges and barriers to reducing emissions mentioned in the documents?",

    # Quantitative: Statistical analysis
    "What is the relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions for European countries between 2010 and 2020?",

    # Quantitative: Trend analysis
    "Which countries had negative emission growth rates in the past 5 years and by how much did their emissions decrease?",

    # Combined: Context + Data
    "How do per capita emissions compare between the US, China, and India in recent years, and what factors explain these differences?",

    # Combined: Insights + Quantification
    "What role does coal play in global emissions according to the documents, and what percentage of total CO2 came from coal in 2022?",
]
```

**Helper Functions**:
```python
def process_queries(queries: List[str], verbose: bool = True) -> List[dict]:
    """Process multiple queries through the LangGraph agent."""

def process_single_query(query: str, verbose: bool = True) -> str:
    """Process a single query through the agent and return the response."""
```

### search-agent/langgraph.json
**Purpose**: LangGraph deployment configuration

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "search_agent": "./agent.py:app"
  },
  "env": ".env"
}
```

### search-agent/README.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation for the search agent

**Sections**:
- Overview and architecture diagram
- Tool descriptions with usage guidelines
- Example queries (updated to match agent.py)
- Deployment instructions
- Environment variables
- Troubleshooting guide
- Development notes on LangGraph best practices

**Updated sections**:
- Removed references to test_agent.py
- Updated testing instructions to run agent.py directly
- Updated example queries to match the 5 diverse queries in agent.py

### doc-process/scripts/doc-to-lance.py
**Why Important**: Referenced for understanding LanceDB hybrid search implementation

**Key Details**:
- Shows hybrid search query pattern
- Documents output format with chunk_id, text, file_name, pages, relevance_score
- Demonstrates LanceDB connection and table structure

### pyproject.toml (Modified)
**Changes**: Added LangGraph dependencies
```toml
dependencies = [
    "langgraph>=0.6.8",
    "langchain-anthropic>=0.3.21",
    "langchain-core>=0.3.78",
    # ... existing dependencies
]
```

### search-agent/test_agent.py (DELETED)
**Why Removed**: User noted that agent.py already includes example queries in __main__ block, making separate test script redundant.

## 4. Problem Solving

**Problem 1: SQL Tool Design**
- **Initial Approach**: sql_query(question: str) - tool would generate SQL from natural language
- **Issue**: User corrected that the LLM should generate SQL, tool should only execute
- **Solution**: Changed to sql_query(sql: str) where LLM generates SQL query and tool executes it
- **Security**: Added validation to only allow SELECT queries

**Problem 2: Unused Imports**
- **Issue**: IDE warnings for unused imports (Annotated, Literal, END)
- **Solution**: Removed unused imports, kept only necessary ones

**Problem 3: Type Errors**
- **Issue**: MyPy warnings on ChatAnthropic and graph.stream
- **Solution**: Added `# type: ignore` comments for LLM and streaming operations

**Problem 4: Example Query Quality**
- **Initial**: Generic queries similar to system prompt examples
- **Issue**: User wanted more diverse, non-obvious queries
- **Solution**: Created 5 queries covering qualitative, quantitative, and combined use cases with specific, realistic scenarios

## 5. Pending Tasks

**Commit and Push** (From beginning of conversation):
- Staged changes: pyproject.toml, uv.lock, doc-process/scripts/doc-to-lance.py
- Proposed commit message: "feat(doc-process): add LanceDB upload script with vector embeddings"
- User did not explicitly approve or reject, moved to LangGraph task instead

**No other explicit pending tasks** - LangGraph agent implementation is complete.

## 6. Current Work

**Most Recent Work**: Finalizing documentation and cleaning up project structure

**Last Actions**:
1. Updated example queries in agent.py to 5 diverse queries (1 qualitative, 2 quantitative, 2 combined)
2. Removed test_agent.py per user request: "Wait, I think u can just remove the test script, because everything is working already"
3. Updated README.md to remove references to test_agent.py
4. Changed testing instructions from `uv run python test_agent.py` to `uv run python agent.py`
5. Updated example queries section in README to match the new queries in agent.py

**Current State**:
- All files complete and properly documented
- Agent follows LangGraph best practices from langgraph-dev-guide.md
- Ready for testing with: `cd search-agent && uv run python agent.py`
- Ready for deployment with langgraph.json configuration

**File Structure**:
```
search-agent/
├── agent.py          # Main LangGraph agent (527 lines)
├── langgraph.json    # Deployment config
└── README.md         # Documentation
```

## 7. Optional Next Step

**No explicit next steps requested**. The LangGraph agent implementation is complete per user specifications.

The conversation concluded with documentation cleanup. User's last statement: "Okay, nice. I think in this case, how many people want to have 5 queries?" followed by specification of the 5 query types, which has been fully implemented.

If the user wants to proceed, logical next steps would be:
1. Test the agent by running `uv run python search-agent/agent.py`
2. Complete the pending commit from the beginning of the conversation
3. Deploy the agent using LangGraph Cloud

However, these are not explicitly requested, so awaiting user direction.
