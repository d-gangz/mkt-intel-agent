    "text": "# CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nBy: Hannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\n\nCite this work Reuse this work\n\nIntroduction Key Insights Data Explorer Research & Writing Charts\n\nHuman emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary driver of climate change today.¹\n\nCO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are emitted when we burn fossil fuels, produce materials such as steel, cement, and plastics, and grow the food we eat. If we want to reduce these emissions, we need to transform our energy systems, industries, and food systems.\n\n- At the same time, we need to tackle energy poverty, low standards of living, and poor nutrition, which all remain enormous problems for billions of people.\n\nTechnological advances could allow us to do both. The prices of solar, wind, and batteries have plummeted in recent decades, increasingly undercutting the cost of fossil fuel alternatives. Further progress could allow us to provide cheap, clean energy for everyone. Political change is essential to create a system that supports rapid decarbonization.\n\nEmissions are still rising in many parts of the world. However, several countries have managed to cut their emissions in recent decades. With affordable low- carbon technologies, other countries can increase their living standards without the high-carbon pathway that rich countries followed in the past.\n\nOn this page, you can find our data, visualizations, and writing on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Key Insights on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nHuman greenhouse gas\nemissions have increased\nglobal average temperatures\n\nGlobal emissions have\nincreased rapidly over the\nlast 50 years and have not\nyet peaked\n\nCurrent climate policies will\nreduce emissions, but not\nenough to keep\ntemperature rise below 2°C\n\nThere are larg\n\nin emissions a\n\nworld\n\nsee this distribution in maps published by Berkeley Earth.\n\nHuman emissions have been the main driver of this change. Aerosols have played a slight cooling role in global climate, and natural variability has played a minor role. This article from Carbon Brief explains this very well, with interactive graphics showing the relative contributions of different factors to the climate.\n\n## WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS DATA\n\n• This data comes from the United Kingdom's Met Office and combines air and sea surface temperatures in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. It is called the \"HadCRUT\" (Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit Temperature) dataset.³\n\n• It measures temperature anomalies across the world at high resolutions.\n\n• There is very strong agreement in temperature trends across the large global datasets measured and produced by other leading institutions.\n\nAnnual temperature anomalies relative to the pre-industrial period, World The difference in average land-sea surface temperature compared to the 1861-1890 mean, in degrees Celsius.\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThe graph shows annual global temperature anomalies relative to the pre-industrial period, from 1850 to 2025. The red line represents the average temperature change, with an overall upward trend indicating increasing temperatures. The gray lines indicate the upper and lower bounds of temperature variations.",

The United States shows the highest peak emissions around 2000-2010 before declining, while China's emissions rise dramatically starting around 1980 and continue at high levels. All countries and the world overall show significant increases in emissions starting in the mid-20th century, with the steepest growth occurring after 1950.\n\nResearch & Writing\n\nThe chart displays multiple colored trend lines tracking CO2 emissions over time, with different countries or regions represented by different colors. Most lines show significant increases from low starting points, with some reaching peaks before declining in recent years, while others continue to rise. The data appears to span several decades and illustrates varying patterns of emissions growth and recent changes across different nations or regions.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023 Per capita, national, historical: how do countries compare on CO2 metrics?

The chart demonstrates a dramatic exponential increase in total emissions, with the largest portion appearing to come from coal (shown in reddish-brown at the bottom), followed by oil and gas in the upper layers. The steep upward trajectory illustrates how fossil fuel emissions have accelerated significantly, particularly in recent decades.\n\nJune 23, 2020\n\nCO2 emissions by fuel\n\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\n\n## Emissions from Energy\n\nJune 10, 2020\n\nGreenhouse gas emi\n\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosac\n\nThis world map displays greenhouse gas emissions data using a color-coded scale, with darker red shades indicating higher emission levels and lighter colors representing lower emissions. Countries in the Middle East, parts of Africa, and some regions in Asia and Eastern Europe show the highest emissions (darkest red), while many countries appear in lighter shades or white indicating lower emission levels. The map includes circular symbols on the right side that likely represent additional data categories or legend information.\n\nNovember 03, 2021\n\nFossil fuel subsidies: If we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we should not pay people to burn fossil fuels Max Roser\n\nEmissions from Transport\n\nDecember 10, 2020\n\nThe world's energy I\n\nMax Roser\n\nThe image is a horizontal stacked bar chart comparing different categories.
