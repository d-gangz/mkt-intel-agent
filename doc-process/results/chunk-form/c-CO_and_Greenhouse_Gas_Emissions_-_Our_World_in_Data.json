    "text": "# CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nBy: Hannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser\n\nCite this work Reuse this work\n\nIntroduction Key Insights Data Explorer Research & Writing Charts\n\nHuman emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary driver of climate change today.¹\n\nCO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are emitted when we burn fossil fuels, produce materials such as steel, cement, and plastics, and grow the food we eat. If we want to reduce these emissions, we need to transform our energy systems, industries, and food systems.\n\n- At the same time, we need to tackle energy poverty, low standards of living, and poor nutrition, which all remain enormous problems for billions of people.\n\nTechnological advances could allow us to do both. The prices of solar, wind, and batteries have plummeted in recent decades, increasingly undercutting the cost of fossil fuel alternatives. Further progress could allow us to provide cheap, clean energy for everyone. Political change is essential to create a system that supports rapid decarbonization.\n\nEmissions are still rising in many parts of the world. However, several countries have managed to cut their emissions in recent decades. With affordable low- carbon technologies, other countries can increase their living standards without the high-carbon pathway that rich countries followed in the past.\n\nOn this page, you can find our data, visualizations, and writing on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Key Insights on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nHuman greenhouse gas\nemissions have increased\nglobal average temperatures\n\nGlobal emissions have\nincreased rapidly over the\nlast 50 years and have not\nyet peaked\n\nCurrent climate policies will\nreduce emissions, but not\nenough to keep\ntemperature rise below 2°C\n\nThere are larg\n\nin emissions a\n\nworld\n\nsee this distribution in maps published by Berkeley Earth.\n\nHuman emissions have been the main driver of this change. Aerosols have played a slight cooling role in global climate, and natural variability has played a minor role. This article from Carbon Brief explains this very well, with interactive graphics showing the relative contributions of different factors to the climate.\n\n## WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS DATA\n\n• This data comes from the United Kingdom's Met Office and combines air and sea surface temperatures in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. It is called the \"HadCRUT\" (Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit Temperature) dataset.³\n\n• It measures temperature anomalies across the world at high resolutions.\n\n• There is very strong agreement in temperature trends across the large global datasets measured and produced by other leading institutions.\n\nAnnual temperature anomalies relative to the pre-industrial period, World The difference in average land-sea surface temperature compared to the 1861-1890 mean, in degrees Celsius.\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThe chart shows global annual temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2025, displaying the difference in average land-sea surface temperature compared to the 1861-1890 baseline period. Temperature anomalies remained relatively stable and close to zero from 1850 to around 1980, with some fluctuations between -0.5°C and +0.5°C. Since 1980, there has been a dramatic and consistent upward trend, with temperatures rising to approximately 1.2°C above the pre-industrial baseline by 2025.",

The United States shows a peak in emissions in the mid-20th century before declining. China and India have rapidly increasing emissions in recent years, with China surpassing the global average.\n\nResearch & Writing\n\nThis line graph displays CO2 emissions trends over time for multiple countries, with different colored lines representing each nation. The chart shows varying trajectories, with some countries (represented by pink and orange lines) exhibiting dramatic increases followed by recent declines, while others show more gradual changes or continued growth. The data appears to span several decades and illustrates the different patterns of carbon emissions across nations as part of a comparative analysis of countries' contributions to climate change.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023 Per capita, national, historical: how do countries compare on CO2 metrics?
