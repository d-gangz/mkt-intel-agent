How are emissions from these fuels changing over time?\n\nBy: Hannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser This page was first published in June 2020. We made minor changes to the text in January 2024.\n\n\n\nCite this article\n\n\n\nReuse our work freely\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy and material production can arise from various sources and fuel types: coal, oil, gas, cement production, and gas flaring.\n\nAs global and national energy systems have transitioned over centuries and decades, the contribution of different fuel sources to CO2 emissions has changed both geographically and temporally.\n\nIn this article we look at the breakdown of CO2 emissions by fuel type, looking at the largest emitters of the past; the largest emitters today; and how these compare when we look at per capita adjustments.\n\n## CO2 emissions by fuel type\n\nCoal, oil, gas, cement: where do CO2 emissions come from?\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions associated with energy and industrial production can come from a range of fuel types. The contribution of each of these sources has changed significantly through time and still shows large differences by region. In the chart we see the absolute and relative contribution of CO2 emissions by source, differentiated between coal, gas, oil, flaring, and cement production.\n\nAt a global level, we see that early industrialization was dominated by the use of solid fuel.\n\nCoal-fired power at an industrial scale was the first to emerge in Europe and North America during the 1700s. It wasn't until the late 1800s that we began to see a growth in emissions from oil and gas production. Another century passed before emissions from flaring and cement production began.\n\nToday, solid and liquid fuels dominate, although contributions from gas production are also notable. Cement and flaring at the global level remain comparably small.\n\n# CO2 emissions by fuel or industry type, World\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThe area chart shows global CO2 emissions from 1750 to 2023, broken down by source. Coal emissions were the earliest contributor, followed by a later surge from oil and gas. More recently, emissions from cement, flaring, and other industries have also increased.\n\nThe trends vary significantly by region. Overall patterns across Europe and North America are similar: early industrialization began through solid fuel consumption, however, through time this energy mix has diversified. Today, CO2 emissions are spread fairly equally between coal, oil, and gas. In contrast, Latin America and the Caribbean's emissions have historically been and remain a product of liquid fuel-even in the early stages of development coal consumption was small. 1\n\nAsia's energy remains dominant in solid fuel consumption and has notably higher cement contributions relative to other regions.²\n\nAfrica also has more notable emissions from cement and flaring; however, its key sources of emissions are a diverse mix of solid, liquid, and gas.\n\n# CO2 emissions by fuel or industry\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThis dashboard displays CO2 emissions by industry sector (cement, coal, flaring, gas, oil, and other industry) across six world regions from 1750 to 2023. Asia shows the most dramatic recent growth, particularly in coal emissions reaching over 12 billion tons, while Africa demonstrates significant increases in gas and oil emissions starting around 1950. Europe and North America show peak emissions in earlier decades with recent declines, while South America and Oceania maintain relatively lower but steadily increasing emission levels.",

    "text": "## Per capita: How do coal, oil, gas, and cement emissions compare?\n\nTotal emissions from different sources - coal, oil, gas, and cement - largely reflect the population of a given country.\n\nHow do these figures compare when we look at them on a per capita basis? This chart shows per capita CO2 emissions from coal, oil, gas, flaring, and cement, measured in tonnes of CO2 per year.\n\nThe distribution across different fuel sources is very dependent on energy production and mix in a given country. In the US or the UK, for example, oil followed by gas are the largest contributors. In China and India, coal is much more dominant. In Russia, it's gas.\n\n# Per capita CO2 emissions by fuel type, World, 2023\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\n| Source | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Coal | 1.9 t |\n| Oil | 1.51 t |\n| Gas | 0.98 t |\n| Cement | 0.19 t |\n| Flaring | 0.05 t |\n| Other industry | 0.04 t |\n\nOurWorldinData.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions | CC BY\n\n# Per capita CO2 emissions by source, 2019\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\n| Country/Region | Coal (t) | Oil (t) | Gas (t) | Flaring (t) | Cement (t) | Other industry (t) | Total (t) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Australia | 6.5 | 5.6 | 3.2 | N/A | N/A | N/A | 16 |\n| United States | 3.2 | 7 | 5 | N/A | N/A | N/A | 16 |\n| Germany | 2.9 | 3.3 | 2.1 | N/A | N/A | N/A | 8.5 |\n| South Africa | 6.6 | 0.93 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 7.8 |\n| China | 5.3 | 1.1 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 7.5 |\n| United Kingdom | N/A | 2.5 | 2.4 | N/A | N/A | N/A | 5.4 |\n| France | N/A | 2.8 | 1.3 | N/A | N/A | N/A | 4.8 |\n| World | 1.9 | 1.6 | 0.98 | N/A | N/A | N/A | 4.8 |\n| Sweden | N/A | 2.8 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 4 |\n| Brazil | N/A | 1.4 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 2.3 |\n| India | 1.2 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1.9 |\n\nRelated: CO₂ data: sources, methods and FAQS\n\n## Emissions from coal\n\n## Annual CO2 emissions from coal\n\nWhich countries are the largest CO2 emitters from coal production?\n\nThis interactive chart shows annual emissions from coal production by country, over time.\n\nWhat becomes clear when we look across countries is how coal production has shifted over time. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, coal production was dominant across countries in Europe (predominantly the UK) and the United States. However, energy transitions in these countries have resulted in significant declines in recent decades.\n\nEmissions from coal have since shifted elsewhere: in recent decades we have seen a rapid rise in emissions from industrializing economies such as China, India, and South Africa.\n\n# Annual CO2 emissions from coal\n\nAnnual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from coal, measured in tonnes.\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThis line chart displays carbon emissions by country from 1750 to 2023, with the y-axis showing values up to 10 billion tons. China shows the most dramatic increase, rising sharply from around 2000 onwards to reach approximately 8 billion tons by 2023, far exceeding all other countries. The United States follows as the second-highest emitter at around 2 billion tons, while other countries including India, Germany, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, and Australia show relatively modest emission levels throughout the time period.\n\n## Per capita CO2 emissions from coal\n\nHow do emissions from coal compare when we adjust for population?\n\nThis interactive chart shows per capita CO2 emissions from coal, measured in tonnes per person per year.\n\n# Per capita CO2 emissions from coal, 2023\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nAnnual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from coal, measured in tonnes per person.\n\nThe map shows annual CO2 emissions from coal per person by country.

If there are no on-site uses for the gas, refineries can either inject it back into the ground, let it vent to the atmosphere, or burn (i.e. flare) it. This flaring process produces greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n# Annual CO2 emissions from flaring\n\nAnnual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from flaring, measured in tonnes.\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThe chart displays CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions from 1750 to 2023 for several countries and regions, with the United States showing the most dramatic increase, peaking at around 85 million tonnes. Most countries show minimal emissions until around 1950, after which there are significant increases, with the US experiencing the steepest rise followed by the European Union, while other countries like Canada, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, and South Africa show more modest increases. The data reveals how emissions have accelerated dramatically in the latter half of the 20th century across all tracked regions.\n\n## Per capita CO2 emissions from gas flaring\n\nHow do emissions from gas flaring compare when we adjust for population?\n\nThis interactive chart shows per capita CO2 emissions from gas flaring, measured in tonnes per person per year.\n\n# Per capita CO2 emissions from flaring, 2023\n\nAnnual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from flaring, measured in tonnes per person.\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThis world map displays CO2 emissions per capita by country for 2023, with darker orange and red colors indicating higher per-capita emissions.
