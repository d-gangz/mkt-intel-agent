How are emissions from these fuels changing over time?\n\nBy: Hannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, and Max Roser This page was first published in June 2020. We made minor changes to the text in January 2024.\n\n\n\nCite this article\n\n\n\nReuse our work freely\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy and material production can arise from various sources and fuel types: coal, oil, gas, cement production, and gas flaring.\n\nAs global and national energy systems have transitioned over centuries and decades, the contribution of different fuel sources to CO2 emissions has changed both geographically and temporally.\n\nIn this article we look at the breakdown of CO2 emissions by fuel type, looking at the largest emitters of the past; the largest emitters today; and how these compare when we look at per capita adjustments.\n\n## CO2 emissions by fuel type\n\nCoal, oil, gas, cement: where do CO2 emissions come from?\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions associated with energy and industrial production can come from a range of fuel types. The contribution of each of these sources has changed significantly through time and still shows large differences by region. In the chart we see the absolute and relative contribution of CO2 emissions by source, differentiated between coal, gas, oil, flaring, and cement production.\n\nAt a global level, we see that early industrialization was dominated by the use of solid fuel.\n\nCoal-fired power at an industrial scale was the first to emerge in Europe and North America during the 1700s. It wasn't until the late 1800s that we began to see a growth in emissions from oil and gas production. Another century passed before emissions from flaring and cement production began.\n\nToday, solid and liquid fuels dominate, although contributions from gas production are also notable. Cement and flaring at the global level remain comparably small.\n\n# CO2 emissions by fuel or industry type, World\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThe image is a line chart showing CO2 emissions in billion tons from 1750 to 2023, broken down by source. Coal, oil, and gas are the primary contributors, with coal starting first and remaining significant. Other industries, cement, and flaring contribute a smaller but growing share of emissions over time.\n\n\nThe trends vary significantly by region. Overall patterns across Europe and North America are similar: early industrialization began through solid fuel consumption, however, through time this energy mix has diversified. Today, CO2 emissions are spread fairly equally between coal, oil, and gas. In contrast, Latin America and the Caribbean's emissions have historically been and remain a product of liquid fuel-even in the early stages of development coal consumption was small. 1\n\nAsia's energy remains dominant in solid fuel consumption and has notably higher cement contributions relative to other regions.²\n\nAfrica also has more notable emissions from cement and flaring; however, its key sources of emissions are a diverse mix of solid, liquid, and gas.\n\n# CO2 emissions by fuel or industry\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThe image displays line graphs of CO2 emissions from various industries across different regions (Asia, Africa, South America, North America, Oceania, and Europe) from 1750 to 2023. Each graph shows how emissions from cement, coal, flaring, gas, oil, and other industries have changed over time.  Generally, there's a significant increase in emissions across all regions, particularly after 1950, though the scale and sources of emissions vary by region.",

    "text": "## Per capita: How do coal, oil, gas, and cement emissions compare?\n\nTotal emissions from different sources - coal, oil, gas, and cement - largely reflect the population of a given country.\n\nHow do these figures compare when we look at them on a per capita basis? This chart shows per capita CO2 emissions from coal, oil, gas, flaring, and cement, measured in tonnes of CO2 per year.\n\nThe distribution across different fuel sources is very dependent on energy production and mix in a given country. In the US or the UK, for example, oil followed by gas are the largest contributors. In China and India, coal is much more dominant. In Russia, it's gas.\n\n# Per capita CO2 emissions by fuel type, World, 2023\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\n| Source | Value (t) |\n|---|---|\n| Coal | 1.9 |\n| Oil | 1.51 |\n| Gas | 0.98 |\n| Cement | 0.19 |\n| Flaring | 0.05 |\n| Other industry | 0.04 |\n\nOurWorldinData.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions | CC BY\n\n# Per capita CO2 emissions by source, 2019\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\n| Country/Region | Coal (t) | Oil (t) | Gas (t) | Flaring (t) | Cement (t) | Other industry (t) | Total (t) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Australia | 6.5 | 5.6 | 3.2 | | | | 16 |\n| United States | 3.2 | 7 | 5 | | | | 16 |\n| Germany | 2.9 | 3.3 | 2.1 | | | | 8.5 |\n| South Africa | 6.6 | 0.93 | | | | | 7.8 |\n| China | 5.3 | 1.1 | | | | | 7.5 |\n| United Kingdom | | 2.5 | 2.4 | | | | 5.4 |\n| France | | 2.8 | 1.3 | | | | 4.8 |\n| World | 1.9 | 1.6 | 0.98 | | | | 4.8 |\n| Sweden | | 2.8 | | | | | 4 |\n| Brazil | | 1.4 | | | | | 2.3 |\n| India | 1.2 | | | | | | 1.9 |\n\nRelated: CO₂ data: sources, methods and FAQS\n\n## Emissions from coal\n\n## Annual CO2 emissions from coal\n\nWhich countries are the largest CO2 emitters from coal production?\n\nThis interactive chart shows annual emissions from coal production by country, over time.\n\nWhat becomes clear when we look across countries is how coal production has shifted over time. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, coal production was dominant across countries in Europe (predominantly the UK) and the United States. However, energy transitions in these countries have resulted in significant declines in recent decades.\n\nEmissions from coal have since shifted elsewhere: in recent decades we have seen a rapid rise in emissions from industrializing economies such as China, India, and South Africa.\n\n# Annual CO2 emissions from coal\n\nAnnual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from coal, measured in tonnes.\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThe line graph shows the CO2 emissions of various countries from 1750 to 2023.  China's emissions have dramatically increased since 2000, far exceeding those of other countries. Most other countries' emissions either plateaued or decreased towards the end of the displayed period.\n\n## Per capita CO2 emissions from coal\n\nHow do emissions from coal compare when we adjust for population?\n\nThis interactive chart shows per capita CO2 emissions from coal, measured in tonnes per person per year.\n\n# Per capita CO2 emissions from coal, 2023\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nAnnual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from coal, measured in tonnes per person.\n\nThis world map displays annual per capita CO2 emissions from coal in 2023, with countries color-coded from light yellow (0 tonnes) to dark brown (5+ tonnes per person). The highest emissions appear concentrated in parts of Asia (particularly China and surrounding regions), Australia, and some areas of North America, while much of Africa and parts of South America show minimal coal-based CO2 emissions per capita. The color gradient clearly illustrates the significant global disparity in coal usage for CO2 emissions on a per-person basis.\n\nData source: Global Carbon Budget (2024); Population based on various sources (2024) - Learn more about this data OurWorldinData.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions | CC BY\n\n→\n\n[\n\n## Emissions from oil\n\nAnnual CO2 emissions from oil\n\nWhich countries are the largest CO2 emitters of oil?\n\nThis interactive chart shows annual emissions from oil by country, over time.",

If there are no on-site uses for the gas, refineries can either inject it back into the ground, let it vent to the atmosphere, or burn (i.e. flare) it. This flaring process produces greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n# Annual CO2 emissions from flaring\n\nAnnual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from flaring, measured in tonnes.\n\nOur World\nin Data\n\nThe line graph shows CO₂ emissions from flaring for several regions from 1750 to 2023.
