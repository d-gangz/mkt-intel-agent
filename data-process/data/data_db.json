    "text": "Our World in Data's comprehensive CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset covering 255 countries and regions from 1750 to 2023 (273 years of historical data). This table contains multi-dimensional climate and emissions data including:\n\nEMISSIONS DATA: Total annual CO2 emissions measured in million tonnes, with detailed breakdowns by fuel source including coal emissions, oil emissions, natural gas emissions, cement production emissions, and gas flaring emissions. Also includes CO2 from land-use change and deforestation. All emission types available in both absolute values and per capita metrics (tonnes per person).\n\nCUMULATIVE METRICS: Historical累積emissions since 1750 for total CO2, coal, oil, gas, cement, and land-use change. These cumulative totals show each country's total contribution to atmospheric CO2 over time.\n\nGREENHOUSE GASES: Beyond CO2, includes methane emissions and nitrous oxide emissions measured in CO2-equivalent units, plus total greenhouse gas emissions combining all three major gases. Available in both total amounts and per capita.\n\nEMISSIONS INTENSITY: Emissions relative to economic activity (CO2 per GDP), emissions per unit of energy consumed, energy consumption per capita, and energy per GDP - useful for understanding efficiency and decoupling of emissions from economic growth.\n\nGLOBAL SHARE: Each country's percentage share of global annual emissions and global cumulative emissions, showing relative responsibility for climate change.\n\nCONSUMPTION-BASED ACCOUNTING: Trade-adjusted emissions showing consumption-based CO2 (what a country consumes vs produces), net CO2 embedded in trade, and trade share - crucial for understanding imported/exported emissions.\n\nTEMPERATURE ATTRIBUTION: Temperature change in degrees Celsius attributed to each country's emissions, broken down by CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and total greenhouse gases.\n\nECONOMIC & DEMOGRAPHIC: Population counts and GDP in constant 2011 international dollars for economic context and per-capita calculations.\n\nGROWTH METRICS: Absolute and percentage year-over-year changes in CO2 emissions to track emission trends and growth rates.\n\nCOVERAGE: Includes individual countries (e.g., United States, China, India, Germany, Brazil) and regional aggregates (World, Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, OECD, EU, income groups). ISO country codes included for standardization.\n\nPERFECT FOR QUERIES ABOUT: Which countries emit the most CO2? How have China's emissions changed since 2000? What is the per capita emission rate of India vs USA? Which fuel type dominates in specific countries? Historical emission trends over decades or centuries. Top emitters ranking globally or by region. Emissions growth rates and trajectories. Coal vs oil vs gas usage patterns by country. Greenhouse gas breakdowns and methane sources. Climate impact and temperature attribution by country. Emissions intensity and decoupling from GDP. Trade-adjusted consumption emissions. Cumulative historical responsibility for climate change. Regional comparisons (Asia vs Europe vs Americas). OECD vs developing countries. Income-based emission patterns. Energy efficiency metrics. Per capita comparisons across countries. Share of global emissions pie. Countries with fastest emission growth. Countries reducing emissions successfully.",

1750-2023 (273 years of historical data)\n- Many early historical values (pre-1900) are NULL or zero, data becomes more complete in 20th century\n- Includes both individual countries and regional/economic aggregates\n- ISO country codes provided for standardization\n\n## Filtering Guidelines\n\n- To exclude aggregate regions when analyzing countries: `WHERE country NOT LIKE '%World%' AND country NOT LIKE '%OECD%' AND country NOT LIKE '%income%'`\n- For recent comprehensive data: `WHERE year >= 2000`\n- For historical analysis: `WHERE year >= 1900` (better data availability)\n- Common NULL handling: Add `AND column_name IS NOT NULL` for per capita and derived metrics\n- To get only countries with ISO codes: `WHERE iso_code IS NOT NULL`\n\n## Example Queries\n\n**1. Top 10 CO2 Emitters in 2022**\n```sql\nSELECT country, co2, co2_per_capita \nFROM data \nWHERE year = 2022 \n  AND country NOT LIKE '%World%' \n  AND country NOT LIKE '%OECD%' \nORDER BY co2 DESC \nLIMIT 10;\n```\n\n**2.

Countries with Fastest Emission Growth (2010-2022)**\n```sql\nSELECT country, \n  MAX(CASE WHEN year = 2022 THEN co2 END) - MAX(CASE WHEN year = 2010 THEN co2 END) as growth\nFROM data\nWHERE year IN (2010, 2022)\n  AND country NOT LIKE '%World%'\n  AND iso_code IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY country\nHAVING growth IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY growth DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n```\n"
